# Steed-Solutions---Initial-Test

Task 1 is almost complete - I couldn't figure out how to plot the trajectory of the updates. However, the 3 methods' outputs are as expected. Gradient Descent and Improved Newton return local minima's of the Himmelblau function in every case, whereas Newton's method doesn't always. 

Task 2 is completed.

Tasks 3 and 4 were attempted but not completed. I have a day job and am currently in the process of moving to a different city (Lahore) for it so am very short on time (at the moment). However, I would have completed them should they have been given to me as tasks for a part-time job. 

Thank you and have a nice day.
