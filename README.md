# Steed-Solutions---Initial-Test

Task 1 is almost complete - I couldn't figure out how to plot the trajectory of the updates. However, the 3 methods' outputs are as expected. Gradient Descent and Improved Newton return local minimas of the Himmelblau function in every case, whereas Newton's method doesn't always. 

Task 2 is completed.

Tasks 3 and 4 were attempted but not completed. I have a day job and am currently in the process of moving to a different city (Lahore) for it so have been very short on time these days. Rest assured this is a temporary issue, and if given a part time position I would definitely do better as I will have more time on my hands.
